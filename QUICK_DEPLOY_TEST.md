# Quick Minimal Test Deployment

## ðŸ§ª Testing with Ultra-Minimal App

I've created a super simple test to isolate the Railway deployment issue:

### Files Changed:
- `railway.toml` â†’ Now uses `Dockerfile.minimal`
- `minimal_test.py` â†’ Enhanced with better PORT handling and debug info
- `Dockerfile.minimal` â†’ Ultra-simple, no user creation, no health checks

### Deploy Now:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Test minimal Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### What This Tests:
- âœ… Basic Python + FastAPI deployment
- âœ… PORT environment variable handling
- âœ… Health check endpoint at `/health`
- âœ… Debug endpoint at `/debug` for troubleshooting

### Expected Results:

**If this works:**
- Health check should pass âœ…
- You can access debug info at `https://your-app.railway.app/debug`
- We can then gradually add back complexity

**If this fails:**
- Check Railway deployment logs for specific errors
- The issue might be more fundamental (Railway configuration, environment variables, etc.)

### Debug Endpoints:
- `/` - Basic app info
- `/health` - Health check (what Railway tests)
- `/debug` - Complete environment and system info

This minimal test will help us identify exactly where the issue is! ðŸŽ¯
